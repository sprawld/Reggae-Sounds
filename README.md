A web app I made for a friend with his face. 

Designed for use on a phone. It works offline using appcache. 
If you save the page to your home screen, it will run natively, full screen.

There's an issue with Android phones, that they won't cache audio files in appcache. I don't know if they've fixed it in later versions.
This sidesteps that by having the mp3 data stored as base64 strings, and decodes them. 
This does increase loading time, be patient.
